_[temporary draft text]_ The Tongva Taraxat Paxaavxa Conservancy is a land-and-culture
conservancy for the
Tongva people. The Conservancy will receive land, create a community center for
Indigenous people, maintain cultural practices, practice ritual, work on language
revitalization, provide housing for Indigenous elders, and archive community documents.

_Taraxat_ is the Tongva word for Indigenous people in the plural. It is used here
in the sense that this conservancy is intended to preserve the people and the culture
of the Tongva as well as the land. _Paxaavxa_ is the Tongva word for a piece of land.
